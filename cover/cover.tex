\author{An effective proof of the Cartan formula: Odd primes}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	This paper is part of a line of work providing natural and effective constructions of cochains enforcing homological relations.
	Previously, such constructions were given for the Cartan and Adem relations over the even prime by Greg Brumfiel, John Morgan, and the second-named author \cite{medina2020cartan,medina2021adem}.
	These constructions have proven instrumental in the classification of certain types of topological states of matter, as illustrated in \cite{barkeshli2021classification}.
