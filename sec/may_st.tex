\section{May--Steenrod structures}\label{s:may_st}

We now present a summary of \cite{medina2021may_st}, which makes explicit the definitions of \cite{steenrod1953cyclic} from the operadic viewpoint of \cite{may1970general}.
We assume familiarity with the notion of operad as presented for example in \cite{may1997operads} or \cite{loday2012operads}.

\subsection{\pdfC-modules}

A \textit{$\cyc$-module} $\cP$ is a set $\{\cP(r)\}_{r>0}$ with $\cP(r)$ a chain complex with a right action of $\cyc_r$.
A \textit{$\cyc$-equivariant map} $\phi \colon \cP_1 \to \cP_2$ is a set $\set{\phi(r) \colon \cP_1(r) \to \cP_2(r)}_{r>0}$ with $\phi(r)$ a $\cyc_r$-equivariant map.
We say $f$ is a chain map or a quasi-isomorphism if each $\phi(r)$ is one.
A similar convention is applied to homotopies.
When convenient, we will abuse notation and denote $\phi(r)$ simply as $\phi$.
There are evident forgetful functors to the category of $\cyc$-modules from those of $\sym$-modules and operads, which we will use without further notice.

\subsection{Minimal cyclic resolution}

By $\cW(r)$ we denote the minimal free resolution of $\Z$ by $\Z[\cyc_r]$-modules
\[
\Z[\cyc_r]\{e_0\} \xla{T} \Z[\cyc_r]\{e_1\} \xla{N} \Z[\cyc_r]\{e_2\} \xla{T} \cdots
\]
where
\[
\begin{split}
	T &= \rho - 1, \\
	N &= 1 + \rho + \cdots + \rho^{r-1}.
\end{split}
\]
The complex $\cW(r)$ is equipped with the structure of a $\cyc_r$-equivariant counital coalgebra
\[
\varepsilon \colon \cW(r) \to \Z, \qquad
\Delta \colon \cW(r) \to \cW(r) \ot \cW(r)
\]
where $\Z$ is acted on trivially by $\cyc_r$ and $\cW(r) \ot \cW(r)$ diagonally.
These maps are defined by $\varepsilon(e_0) = 1$ and
\begin{align*}
%	\varepsilon(e_0) &= 1, \\
	\Delta(e_{2i}) &=
	\sum_{i=j+k} e_{2j} \ot e_{2k} \ + \! \sum_{i-1=j+k} \ \sum_{0 \leq s < t < r} \rho^s e_{2j+1} \ot \rho^t e_{2k+1}, \\
	\Delta(e_{2i+1}) &=
	\sum_{i=j+k} e_{2j} \ot e_{2k+1} \ +\ e_{2j+1} \ot \rho e_{2k}.
\end{align*}

We denote by $\cW$ the $\cyc$-module $\set{\cW(r)}_{r > 0}$.

\subsection{May--Steenrod structures}

Recall that an $E_\infty$-algebra structure on a chain complex $A$ is an operad morphism to $\End(A) = \{\Hom(A^{\ot r}, A)\}_{r>0}$ from an operad $\cR$ such that, for each $r > 0$, the following holds: \textit{i}) the chain complex $\cR(r)$ has the homology of a point, and \textit{ii}) its $\sym_r$-action is free.

A \textit{May--Steenrod structure} on an chain complex $A$ is an $E_\infty$-algebra structure $\phi \colon \cR \to \End(A)$ on $A$ together with a $\cyc$-equivariant quasi-isomorphism $\iota \colon \cW \to \cR$.
We write $\psi$ for $\phi \comp \iota$ and abusively use it to denote the May--Steenrod structure.
We refer to a chain complex with a May--Steenrod structure as a \textit{May--Steenrod complex}.

A May--Steenrod complex $(A,\psi)$ has a preferred product $\psi(2)(e_0) \colon A \ot A \to A$ which we denote for elements $a, b \in A$ simply as $a \cp b$.
Generalizing this, we refer to $\psi(r)(e_i) \colon A^{\ot r} \to A$ as the \textit{cup-$(r,i)$ product}, denoting it $\psi_i^r$ or simply $\psi_i$ when $r$ is clear from the context.

\subsection{Homology operations}\label{ss:homology_operations}

Let $(A,\psi)$ be a May--Steenrod complex.
After extending scalars to $\Fp$ the assignment sending $a$ to $\psi_i(a^{\ot p})$ sends cycles to cycles and we denote its induced linear map in homology by
\[
\rD_i^p \colon \rH_n(A; \Fp) \to \rH_{np+i}(A; \Fp).
\]
We will focus on these homology operations rather than the operations $P_s$ and $\beta P_s$ which we define below.
An essential statement that underpins their definition was attributed to Thom by Steenrod in \cite[Theorem~4.8]{steenrod1947products}.
For completeness, in \cref{s:thom} we will provide an effective proof of this.

\begin{theorem}[Thom]\label{t:thom}
	The map $\rD_i^p$ is $0$ unless for some $\varepsilon \in \{0,1\}$ either: $n$ is even and $i+\varepsilon$ is an even multiple of $(p-1)$ or $n$ is odd and $i+\varepsilon$ is an odd multiple of $(p-1)$.
\end{theorem}

With this in mind, one defines the Steenrod operations
\begin{align*}
	P_s \colon& H_\bullet(A; \Fp) \to H_{\bullet + 2s(p-1)}(A; \Fp), \\
	\beta P_s \colon& H_\bullet(A; \Fp) \to H_{\bullet + 2s(p-1) - 1}(A; \Fp),
\end{align*}
by sending the class represented by a cycle $a \in A \ot \Fp$ of degree $n$ to the classes represented respectively for $\varepsilon \in \{0,1\}$ by
\begin{equation*}
	(-1)^s \nu(n) \, \rD^p_{(2s-n)(p-1)-\varepsilon}[a] \,,
\end{equation*}
where $\nu(n) = (-1)^{n(n-1)m/2}(m!)^n$ and $m = \floor{p/2} = (p-1)/2$.
The constant $\nu(n)$ and notation $\beta P_s$ are motivated respectively by the unstable $\rD_{n(p-1)}^p[\alpha] = \nu(n)[\alpha]$ and Bockstein relations $\beta P_s = \beta \comp P_s$ respectively.
The first holding in the cohomology of spaces and the second in general.
