\section{May--Steenrod structures}

We now present a summary of \cite{medina2021may_st}, which makes explicit the definitions of \cite{steenrod1953cyclic} from the general viewpoint of \cite{may1970general}.

\sssec\label{sss:minimal resolution}

Let $\cyc_r$ denote the cyclic group of order $r$ thought of as the subgroup of the symmetric group $\sym_r$ generated by $\rho = (1,2,\dots,r)$.
Let $\cW(r)$ by the non-negatively graded chain complex
\begin{equation} \label{eq: minimal resolution}
	\Z[\cyc_r]\{e_0\} \xla{T} \Z[\cyc_r]\{e_1\} \xla{N} \Z[\cyc_r]\{e_2\} \xla{T} \cdots
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation} \label{eq: T and R definition}
	\begin{split}
		T &= \rho - 1, \\
		N &= 1 + \rho + \cdots + \rho^{r-1}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
It is equipped with the structure of a coalgebra in the category of $\cyc_r$-equivariant chain complexes, defined explicitly by
\begin{align*}
	\varepsilon(e_0) &= 1, \\
	\Delta(e_{2i}) &=
	\sum_{i=j+k} e_{2j} \ot e_{2k} \ + \sum_{i-1=j+k} \ \sum_{0 \leq r < s \leq p} \rho^r e_{2j+1} \ot \rho^s e_{2k+1}, \\
	\Delta(e_{2i+1}) &=
	\sum_{i=j+k} e_{2j} \ot e_{2k+1} \ +\ e_{2j+1} \ot \rho e_{2k}.
\end{align*}

%Let $\Fp(q)$ \TBW.
%It follows from a straightforward computation that for any prime $p$ and integer $q$
%\begin{equation*}
%	H_i(\cyc_p; \Fp(q)) = \Fp.
%\end{equation*}

\subsection{Cyclic modules}

Similarly to how a group can be regarded as category, we assemble the cyclic groups into a groupoid $\cyc$ whose set of objects is $\N$ and morphisms are given by
\[
\cyc(r,s) =
\begin{cases}
	\cyc_r & r = s, \\
	\hfil \emptyset & r \neq s.
\end{cases}
\]

The category of $\cyc$-modules is that of contravariant functors from $\cyc$ to the category of chain complexes.
Explicitly, a $\cyc$-module $\cP$ is the data of a chain complex $\cP(r)$ with a right $\cyc_r$-action for each $r > 0$, and a morphism is given by a collection of equivariant maps.
The main example of a $\cyc$-module is given by $\cW = \{\cW(r)\}_{r>0}$.
We say that a $\cyc$-module morphisms is a chain complex or a quasi-isomorphism if each of the maps defining it is.
The definition of $\sym$-modules is similar.
Notice that an $\sym$-module is canonically a $\cyc$-module, and that (algebraic) operads are examples.

\subsection{May--Steenrod structures}

A May--Steenrod structure on an chain complex $A$ is the data of a $\cyc$-module morphism
\[
\psi \colon \cW \xra{\iota} \cR \xra{\phi} \End(A)
\]
factoring through an $E_\infty$-operad such that $\iota$ is a quasi-isomorphism and $\phi$ is a morphism of operads.
In particular, this structure makes $A$ into an $E_\infty$-algebra with a preferred product $\psi(2)(e_0) \colon A \ot A \to A$ which we denote for elements $a,b \in A$ simply as $a \smallsmile b$.
Generalizing this, we refer to $\psi(r)(e_i) \colon A^{\ot r} \to A$ as the cup-$(r,i)$ product of $A$, denoting it $\psi_i^r$ or simply $\psi_i$ when $r$ is clear from the context.

\subsection{Homology operations}

Let $A$ be equipped with a May--Steenrod structure $\psi$.
The assignment in $A \ot \Fp$ sending $a$ to $\psi_i^p(a^{\ot p})$ is linear and maps cycles to cycles.
We denote the induced map on the mod p homology of $A$ by
\[
\rD_i^p[a] = \big[\psi_i^p(a \ot\dotsb\ot a)\big].
\]

For an integer $s$, the Steenrod operations
\begin{align*}
	P_s \colon& H_\bullet(A; \mathbb{F}_p) \to H_{\bullet + 2s(p-1)}(A; \mathbb{F}_p), \\
	\beta P_s \colon& H_\bullet(A; \mathbb{F}_p) \to H_{\bullet + 2s(p-1) - 1}(A; \mathbb{F}_p),
\end{align*}
are defined by sending the class represented by a cycle $a \in (A \otimes \mathbb{F}_p)$ of degree $q$ to the classes represented respectively for $\varepsilon \in\{0,1\}$ by
\begin{equation*}
	(-1)^s \nu(q) \rD^p_{(2s-q)(p-1)-\varepsilon}[a]
\end{equation*}
where $\nu(q) = (-1)^{q(q-1)m/2}(m!)^q$ and $m = \floor{p/2} = (p-1)/2$.

%\begin{remark*}[{\cite[(6.1)]{steenrod1953cyclic}}]
%	For a degree $-q$ cohomology class $[\alpha]$ of a space one has the identity $\rD_{q(p-1)}^p[\alpha] = \nu(q)[\alpha]$.
%\end{remark*}
%
%\begin{remark*}
%	The notation $\beta P_s$ is motivated by the relationship of this operator and the Bockstein of the reduction $\Z \to \Z/p\Z$.
