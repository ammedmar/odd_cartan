\subsection*{Outline}

In \cref{s:preliminaries} we recall the Eilenberg--Zilber contraction and introduce the , a shuffle permutation in the symmetric group $\sym_{2r}$ for any $r$.
We present in \cref{s:may_st} a summary of \cite{medina2021may_st}, which makes explicit the definitions of Steenrod operations \cite{steenrod1953cyclic} from the operadic viewpoint of May \cite{may1970general}.
\cref{s:cartan} is devoted to introducing the notions of Cartan relator and Cartan coboundary, whereas \cref{s:effective} focuses on the effective construction of these for simplicial sets.
We present in \cref{s:postponed} a relatively long proof postponed from the previous section, and in \cref{s:thom} we provide an effective proof of a theorem of Thom used in the construction of Steenrod operations.
