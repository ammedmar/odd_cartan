\subsection*{Outline}

In \cref{s:preliminaries} we set up our conventions and recall some basic constructions.
We present in \cref{s:may_st} a summary of \cite{medina2021may_st}, which makes effective the definitions of Steenrod operations \cite{steenrod1953cyclic} from the operadic viewpoint of May \cite{may1970general}.
\cref{s:cartan} is devoted to introducing the notions of Cartan relator and Cartan coboundary, whereas \cref{s:effective} focuses on the effective construction of these for simplicial sets.
In \cref{s:equivariant homotopy general} we provide a procedure to construct equivariant homotopies, which we use to present, in \cref{s:postponed}, a relatively long proof postponed from the previous section, and, in \cref{s:thom}, also an effective proof of a theorem of Thom used in the definition of Steenrod operations.
