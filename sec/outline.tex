\subsection*{Outline}

In \cref{s:preliminaries} we recall the Eilenberg--Zilber contraction and introduce the basic reordering, a shuffle permutation in the symmetric group $\sym_{2r}$ for any $r$.
We present in \cref{s:may_st} a summary of \cite{medina2021may_st}, which makes explicit the definitions of Steenrod operations \cite{steenrod1953cyclic} from the general viewpoint of May \cite{may1970general}.
\cref{s:cartan} is devoted to introducing the notions of Cartan relator and Cartan coboundary, whereas \cref{s:effective} to the effective construction of these for the cochains of spaces.
We present in \cref{s:postponed} a proof postponed from the previous section.
