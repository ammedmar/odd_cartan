\section{Introduction} \label{s:introduction}

Steenrod introduced in \cite{steenrod1947products} his celebrated squares
\begin{equation*}
	\Sq^k \colon \rH^\vee(X; \Ftwo) \to \rH^\vee(X; \Ftwo)
\end{equation*}
via an effective construction of cup-$i$ products on integral cochains
\[
\cp_i \colon \cochains(X) \ot \cochains(X) \to \cochains(X)
\]
satisfying
\[
\Sq^{i-\bars{\alpha}}[\alpha] \defeq [\alpha \cp_i \alpha].
\]
Here $\alpha$ is a mod $2$ cocycle and $[\alpha]$ is its mod $2$ cohomology class.
The cup-$0$ product induces the cup product in cohomology, whose interaction with the Steenrod squares is controlled by the Cartan formula
\[
\Sq^k\!\big([\alpha] [\beta]\big) = \sum_{i+j=k} \Sq^i [\alpha] \Sq^j[\beta].
\]
This relation implies the existence of a coboundary $\delta\zeta_i(\alpha,\beta)$ for any two mod $2$ cocycles that satisfies:
\begin{equation}\label{e:lift cartan even}
	\delta\zeta_i(\alpha, \beta) =
	(\alpha \smallsmile_0 \beta) \cp_i (\alpha \cp_0 \beta) \ +
	\sum_{i=j+k} (\alpha \smallsmile_j \alpha) \cp_i (\beta \cp_k \beta).
\end{equation}
Inspired by the application of cup-$i$ products in the investigation of symmetry-protected topological phases (refer to \cite{kapustin2015cobordism, gaiotto2016spin, kapustin2017fermionic} for examples), Kapustin inquired about an effective natural construction of $\zeta_i(\alpha, \beta)$.
This was presented in \cite{medina2020cartan} and later employed in \cite{barkeshli2021classification} for classifying fermionic $(2+1)$-dimensional invertible phases.

Not long after Steenrod's effective construction was introduced, a non-effective perspective based on group homology was developed.
This new approach allowed the definition not only of Steenrod squares but also of their generalizations for odd primes, known as Steenrod operations:
\begin{align*}
	P_s \colon& \rH^\vee(X; \Fp) \to \rH^\vee(X; \Fp), \\
	\beta P_s \colon& \rH^\vee(X; \Fp) \to \rH^\vee(X; \Fp),
\end{align*}
whose interactions with the cup product are also controlled by Cartan formulas:
\begin{align*}
	\rP_s\big([a][b]\big) =&
	\sum_{i+j=s} \rP_i[a] \, \rP_j[b], \\
	\beta\rP_s\big([a][b]\big) =&
	\sum_{i+j=s} \beta\rP_{i+1}[a] \, \rP_j[b] \ +\ (-1)^{\bars{a}} \rP_i[a] \, \beta\rP_{j+1}[b].
\end{align*}

By extending the concept of cup-$i$ products to other primes, an efficient construction of Steenrod operations was introduced in \cite{medina2021may_st} and implemented in the specialized computer algebra system \texttt{ComCH} \cite{medina2021comch}.
The primary objective of this paper is to utilize these cup-$(p,i)$ products to lift the Cartan formulas to the cochain level, and to effectively construct natural coboundaries that generalize $\zeta_i(a,b)$ in \cref{e:lift cartan even} for odd primes.
