\section{Introduction} \label{s:introduction}

Steenrod introduced in \cite{steenrod1947products} his celebrated cohomology operations
\begin{equation*}
	\Sq^k \colon \rH^\vee(X; \Ftwo) \to \rH^\vee(X; \Ftwo)
\end{equation*}
via an effective construction of cup-$i$ products on integral cochains
\[
\cp_i \colon \cochains(X) \ot \cochains(X) \to \cochains(X)
\]
satisfying
\[
\Sq^{i-\bars{\alpha}}[\alpha] \defeq [\alpha \cp_i \alpha].
\]
The cup-$0$ product induces the cup product in cohomology, whose interaction with the Steenrod squares is constrained by the Cartan formula
\[
\Sq^k\!\big([\alpha] [\beta]\big) = \sum_{i+j=k} \Sq^i [\alpha] \Sq^j[\beta].
\]
For any two cocycles, this relation implies the existence of a coboundary $\delta\zeta_i(\alpha,\beta)$ satisfying:
\begin{equation}\label{e:lift cartan even}
	\delta\zeta_i(\alpha, \beta) =
	(\alpha \smallsmile_0 \beta) \cp_i (\alpha \cp_0 \beta) \ +
	\sum_{i=j+k} (\alpha \smallsmile_j \alpha) \cp_i (\beta \cp_k \beta).
\end{equation}
Motivated by the use of cup-$i$ products in the study of symmetry protected topological phases (see for example \cite{kapustin2015cobordism, gaiotto2016spin, kapustin2017fermionic}), Kapustin asked for an effective construction of $\zeta_i(\alpha, \beta)$ natural in the given cocycles.
Such construction was provided in \cite{medina2020cartan} and used in \cite{barkeshli2021classification} for the classification of fermionic $(2+1)$-dimensional invertible phases.

Soon after Steenrod's construction appeared, Adem, Cartan, Steenrod and others developed a viewpoint grounded on group homology to define Steenrod squares and their generalizations to odd primes, the Steenrod operations:
\begin{align*}
	P_s \colon& \rH^\vee(X; \Fp) \to \rH^\vee(X; \Fp), \\
	\beta P_s \colon& \rH^\vee(X; \Fp) \to \rH^\vee(X; \Fp),
\end{align*}
whose interactions with the cup product are also controlled by Cartan formulas:
\begin{align*}
	\rP_s\big([a][b]\big) =&
	\sum_{i+j=s} \rP_i[a] \, \rP_j[b], \\
	\beta\rP_s\big([a][b]\big) =&
	\sum_{i+j=s} \beta\rP_{i+1}[a] \, \rP_j[b] \ +\ (-1)^{\bars{a}} \rP_i[a] \, \beta\rP_{j+1}[b].
\end{align*}

By generalizing the cup-$i$ products to other primes, an effective construction of Steenrod operations was introduced in \cite{medina2021may_st}.
The goal of this paper is to use these cup-$(p,i)$ products to lift the Cartan formulas to the cochain level and effectively construct natural coboundaries generalizing $\zeta_i(a,b)$ in \cref{e:lift cartan even} to odd primes.
