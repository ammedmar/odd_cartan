\section{Introduction} \label{s:introduction}

\noindent Steenrod introduced in \cite{steenrod1947products} his celebrated square operations
\[
\Sq^k \colon \rH^*(X; \Ftwo) \to \rH^*(X; \Ftwo)
\]
on the mod~2 cohomology of simplicial sets, constructing explicitly a degree $i$ map
\[
\cp_i \colon \cochains(X) \ot \cochains(X) \to \cochains(X)
\]
for each $i \in \N$.
These define $\Sq^{i-\bars{\alpha}}[\alpha] = [\alpha \cp_i \alpha]$ for $\alpha$ a mod $2$ cocycle and $[\alpha]$ its represented cohomology class.
The cup-$0$ product induces the product in cohomology $[\alpha] \cdot [\beta] = [\alpha \cp_0 \beta]$, whose interaction with the Steenrod squares is controlled by the Cartan formula:
\[
\Sq^k\!\big([\alpha] \cdot [\beta]\big) = \sum_{i+j=k} \Sq^i [\alpha] \cdot \Sq^j[\beta].
\]
This relation in cohomology implies the existence, for any pair of mod $2$ cocycles, of a coboundary $\delta\zeta_i(\alpha,\beta)$ satisfying:
\begin{equation}\label{e:lift cartan even}
	\delta\zeta_i(\alpha, \beta) =
	(\alpha \smallsmile_0 \beta) \cp_i (\alpha \cp_0 \beta) \ +
	\sum_{i=j+k} (\alpha \smallsmile_j \alpha) \cp_0 (\beta \cp_k \beta).
\end{equation}

Inspired by the application of cup-$i$ products in the theory of topological phases of matter (refer to \cite{kapustin2015cobordism, gaiotto2016spin, kapustin2017fermionic} for examples), Kapustin inquired about the construction of natural cochains $\zeta_i(\alpha, \beta)$ as in \eqref{e:lift cartan even}.
This was presented in \cite{medina2020cartan} and later used in \cite{barkeshli2021classification} to classify symmetry-protected fermionic $(2+1)$-dimensional invertible phases.

Not long after Steenrod's construction was introduced, a non-explicit perspective based on group homology was developed, which allowed the definition not only of Steenrod squares but also of Steenrod operations
\begin{align*}
	\rP_s \colon& \rH^*(X; \Fp) \to \rH^*(X; \Fp) \\
	\beta \rP_s \colon& \rH^*(X; \Fp) \to \rH^*(X; \Fp)
\end{align*}
for odd primes.
The interaction of these with the cup product are also controlled by Cartan formulas:
\begin{align*}
	\rP_{s}\big([a][b]\big) =&
	\sum_{j+k=s} \rP_j[a] \, \rP_k[b], \\
	\beta \rP_{s+1}\big([a][b]\big) =&
	\sum_{j+k=s} \beta \rP_{j+1}[a] \, \rP_k[b] \ +\ (-1)^{\bars{a}} \rP_j[a] \, \beta \rP_{k+1}[b].
\end{align*}

By extending the concept of cup-$i$ products to other primes via the introduction of cup-$(p,i)$ products, an explicit construction of Steenrod operations was introduced in \cite{medina2021may_st} and implemented in the computer algebra system \texttt{ComCH} \cite{medina2021comch}.
The goal of this paper is to utilize these cup-$(p,i)$ products to lift the Cartan formulas to the cochain level, and to explicitly construct natural coboundaries that generalize $\zeta_i(a,b)$ in \cref{e:lift cartan even} for odd primes.
Our method for constructing these odd Cartan coboundaries is solely based on the combinatorial structure of simplices, which enables a computer to carry out the process locally, focusing on individual simplices sequentially.
An actual implementation of such algorithm is left to future work.

An important result used in the definition of Steenrod operations is a theorem attributed to Thom by Steenrod \cite{steenrod1953cyclic}, which characterizes the image in mod $p$ homology of the inclusion of the cyclic group of order $p$ into the symmetric group $\sym_p$.
Since this theorem plays an indirect role in our constructions, we present an effective proof of it in \cref{s:thom}.

Finally, we remark that in \cite{brumfiel2023explicit} Greg Brumfiel and John Morgan indicate that a result similar to ours is expected in their upcoming work.
