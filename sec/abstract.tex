\begin{abstract}
	The Cartan formula encodes the relationship between the cup product and the action of the Steenrod algebra in $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology. In this work, we complement earlier work done over the even prime and present an effective proof of the Cartan formula at the cochain level when $p$ is prime. More explicitly, for an arbitrary pair of cocycles and any non-negative integer, we construct a natural coboundary that descends to the associated instance of the Cartan formula. Our construction of Cartan coboundaries works for general algebras over the Barratt--Eccles operad, in particular, for the singular cochains of spaces, a case for which we have developed open source software.
