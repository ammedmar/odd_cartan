\begin{abstract}
	The Cartan formulas connect the cup product and the action of the Steenrod algebra on the mod~$p$ cohomology of spaces.
	We provide a cochain level proof of these formulas for odd primes complementing previous work focused on the even prime.
	Explicitly, for any pair of mod~$p$ cocycles and a non-negative integer, we construct a natural cochain descending to the corresponding Cartan formula in cohomology.
