\begin{abstract}
	The Cartan formula connects the cup product and the action of the Steenrod algebra on the $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology of spaces.
	We provide an effective proof of the Cartan formula at the cochain level for odd primes, complementing previous work focused on the even prime.
	Explicitly, for any pair of cocycles and a non-negative integer, we construct a natural coboundary inducing the corresponding instance of the Cartan formula in $\Fp$-cohomology.
