	We provide an effective proof of the Cartan formula at the cochain level for odd primes, complementing previous work focused on the even prime. The Cartan formula elucidates the connection between the cup product and the Steenrod algebra's action on $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology. For any pair of cocycles and a non-negative integer, we construct a natural coboundary that leads to the corresponding instance of the Cartan formula. Our methodology for generating Cartan coboundaries is applicable to general algebras over the Barratt--Eccles operad, including the singular cochains of spaces, for which we have developed open-source software.
%	The Cartan formula encodes the relationship between the cup product and the action of the Steenrod algebra in $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology. We complement earlier work done over the even prime and present an effective proof of the Cartan formula at the cochain level when $p$ is odd. More explicitly, for an arbitrary pair of cocycles and any non-negative integer, we construct a natural coboundary that descends to the associated instance of the Cartan formula. Our construction of Cartan coboundaries works for general algebras over the Barratt--Eccles operad, in particular, for the singular cochains of spaces, a case for which we have developed open source software.
