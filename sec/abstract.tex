\begin{abstract}
	The Cartan formula connects the cup product and the action of the Steenrod algebra on the mod $p$ cohomology of spaces.
	We provide an cochain level proof of the Cartan formula for odd primes complementing previous work focused on the even prime.
	Explicitly, for any pair of cocycles and a non-negative integer, we construct a natural coboundary descending to the corresponding instance of the Cartan formula in mod $p$ cohomology.
