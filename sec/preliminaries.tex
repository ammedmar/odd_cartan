\section{Preliminaries}

Throughout this work $p$ will denote an odd prime and $\Fp$ the field with $p$ elements.
We will assume the ground ring to be $\Z$ unless stated otherwise.
We use homological grading, with the linear dual of an element in degree $d$ placed in degree $-d$.

\subsection{The basic reordering}\label{ss:reordering}

For any $r\in\N$, the element $\tau_r \in \sym_{2r}$ is the shuffle permutation mapping the first and second ``decks'' to odd and even integers respectively.
Explicitly, for $\ell \in \{1,\dots,2r\}$ we have
\begin{equation*}
	\tau_r(\ell) =
	\begin{cases}
		2\ell-1 & \ell \leq r, \\
		2(\ell-r) & \ell > r.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
When $r$ is clear from the context we will omit it from the subscript of this permutation.
In a graded module we have
\[
\tau(a^{\ot r} \ot b^{\ot r}) =
(-1)^{\frac{(r-1)r}{2}\bars{a}\bars{b}} \, (a \ot b)^{\ot r}.
\]
